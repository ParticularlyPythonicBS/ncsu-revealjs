# NCSU-themed Revealjs Extension For Quarto

A [quarto extension](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) featuring an [NCState-inspired theme](https://brand.ncsu.edu/downloads/) for the [reveal.js format](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/).

## Developer Notes

We created the quarto extension for the revealjs format by using:

```sh
quarto create extension format:revealjs
```

From there, we incorporated a modified version of the [Beamer Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) that was ported into a [Quarto theme](https://codeberg.org/pat-s/quarto-metropolis) by [Patrick Schratz](https://pat-s.me/) ([Post](https://pat-s.me/quarto-metropolis-theme/)).

## Acknowledgements

This theme is a derivative of the [Illinois-revealjs](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/illinois-revealjs) theme by the [James J Balamuta](https://github.com/coatless).

Additionally, I relied upon the following resources:
